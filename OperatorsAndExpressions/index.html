Q1. Add two Numbers

You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.

A1. const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {
    return a+b;
};

Q2. Find if the conditions are obeyed or not?

You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.

A2. const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {
    if(a < 10 && a > b){
      return "true";
    } else{
      return "false";
    }
  };

Q3. Check the conditons

You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:
if both are divisible by 10 console true.
if both are not divisible by 10 console false.
if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.
Use operator to do this.

A3. const Check = (A, B) => 
{
  if (A%10===0 && B%10===0){
    return "true";
  } 
  else if (A%10!==0 && B%10!==0){
    return "false";
  } 
  else {
    return "true";
  }
};

Q4. Find the first digit of a 4 digit number

You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.

A4. const First_Digit = (n) => {
    return parseInt(n/1000);
  };

Q5. Find the last digit of a 4 digit number

You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.

A5. const Last_Digit = (n) => {
    const result = String(n).charAt(3);
    return result;
 };

Q6. Find the remainder

You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as  divisor and B as  dividend.Your task is find the remainder.

A6. const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
    const c = b%a;
    return c;
 };

Q7. Multipy two Numbers

You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to multiply these two numbers.

A7. const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
    const result = a*b;
    return result;
  };

Q8. Marks Calculator

Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A, B, and C (out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average.

A8. const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
{
 const sum = A+B+C;
 return sum;
};

const Average = (A, B, C) => 
{
 const average = (A+B+C)/3;
 return average;
};
